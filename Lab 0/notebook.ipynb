These notebooks will be hosted, submitted, and graded on Mimir, the website you're currently logged into. \n\nThis first lab is intended to briefly acquaint you with how to submit notebook assignments on Mimir. We will go over the details of how to use Jupyter notebooks for Python development in class."

Your job is to complete these exercises — adhering to any criteria given — such that they pass all the tests. Additional tests may also be run when you submit the notebook for grading. Your score is typically available immediately, and you may resubmit your work as many times as you wish (with a 5-minute cooldown period) before the deadline. \n\nBecause we haven't gone over any Python syntax in class yet, we'll keep this exercise really simple. To complete this exercise, change the body of the following function so that it returns a palindrome — a string that reads the same backwards as forwards — of your choice. The palindrome has to be at least 2 letters long!"
